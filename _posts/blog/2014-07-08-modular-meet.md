The fourth coming together of all things modular synth took place in the Creativity Zone at the University of Sussex on Saturday the 28th of June, as the ‘Brighton Modular Meet’. Organised by Andrew Duff in conversation with like-minded synth obsessives on the [Muffwiggler](http://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/) forum, the [Brighton Beep](https://www.facebook.com/brighton.beep) Collective and the Modular Synthesizer Meetup, the Brighton Modular Meet provided a great opportunity for the weaving-together of ideas, know-how and help between, newbies, serious dabblers, artists, boutique synthesizer makers, suppliers and academics, all from a wide variety of fields.

Feelings of technological bewilderment, mixed with some anxiety may be experienced by the uninitiated at such a niche gathering – you are confronted by an intense, intricate wall of voltage-control generated audio, patch-cables, modules and beards of every conceivable dexterity; however this quickly passes when you realise how personable people are, with many very happy to demo, explain (and sometimes re-explain) how their setups work to an ultra-newbies like me.

“They have become more relaxed and less intimidating since the first Brighton event two years ago” Andrew says, “it’s good to have artists makers and suppliers in the same room talking to each other, this is happening more and its great to put a face to a name”.

Thank you to all who attended, until the next modular meet.
