The Music Informatics and Performance Technologies Lab, located in the Department of Music in the School of Media, Film and Music, aims to initiate and consolidate diverse research across the university in specific areas of musical technologies through both theoretical research and practical development. The lab functions both as an internal platform for presentations, collaborations and critique, as well as outwards representation of research activities, potentially yielding further connections and international collaborations.

With research foci ranging from computational creativity and music information retrieval to new instrument design and live performance studies, the lab seeks to contribute to a renewed technological engagement with music and musical cultures through a questioning of established techno-cultural practices. This pertains equally to the production, dissemination, and reception of digital music, where novel approaches in the analysis and composition of music are explored through computational methods. Furthermore, the lab is a platform for a media-archaeological approach in music technology that explores the multifaceted development of acoustic instruments with analogue equipment and digital devices. Novel means for musical expression such as live coding, new interfaces, and post-digital approaches are actively researched and developed.
